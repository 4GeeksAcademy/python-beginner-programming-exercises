These exercises are the ideal first step for anyone trying to learn Python. We start with the most simple challenge, like printing a message on the terminal and slowly increase step by step.

This particular series is for Python beginners. You will learn:

1.- The `print` function.

2.- Data-Types. 

3.- Lists and Tuples. 

4.- Functions and dictionaries.

The entire tutorial is 👆 interactive, ✅ auto-graded, and has 📹 video tutorials.

These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspellings please contribute and report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-beginner-programming-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-beginner-programming-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically, you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

1. Make sure you have [LearnPack](https://learnpack.co) installed, node.js version 14+, and Python version 3+. This is the command to install LearnPack:

```bash
$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack@2.1.20 -g && learnpack plugins:install @learnpack/python@1.0.0
```

2. Clone or download this repository in your local environment.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-beginner-programming-exercises.git
$ cd python-beginner-programming-exercises
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ pip3 install pytest==6.2.5 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small Python application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry Python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
