<h2>One click installation:</h2>

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-beginner-programming-exercises.git)


## Local Installation

1) Make sure you have the [breathecode-cli](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) installed and `node.js` version 10+ and python version 3+. This is the command to install the breathecode-cli
```
$ npm i breathecode-cli -g
```

2) Clone or download this repository. Once you finish downloading, you will find a new folder with a subdirectory "exercises" that contains all the exercises within.

3) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
$ pip install pytest==4.4.2 mock pytest-testdox
$ breathecode run
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
