These exercises are the ideal first step for anyone trying to learn Python. We start with the most simple challenge, like printing a message on the terminal and slowly increase step by step.

This particular series is for Python beginners. You will learn:

1. The `print` function.

2. Data-Types. 

3. Lists and Tuples. 

4. Functions and dictionaries.

The entire tutorial is 👆 interactive, ✅ auto-graded, and has 📹 video tutorials.

These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspellings please contribute and report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-beginner-programming-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-beginner-programming-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically, you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

1. Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below.

2. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials, and the Python compiler plugin for LearnPack. Make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```bash
$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack@2.1.20 -g && learnpack plugins:install @learnpack/python@1.0.0
```

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ pip3 install pytest==6.2.5 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small Python application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry Python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
