# `10` Calling Your First Function

Functions are amazing because of many things, but mainly because you can encapsulate your code in pieces and re-use those pieces several times without having to type all that code again.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please, write all of your code inside the `my_main_code` function.

2. The function `is_odd` is defined at the beginning of the code, please call that function inside `my_main_code` passing it the number `45345` and print the result on the console.


## :mag_right: Important:

There's a series of exercises dedicated to Functions [here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-functions-programming-exercises), we encourage you to go and finish those after your **first Function exercise** (And then... come back! :smiley).
