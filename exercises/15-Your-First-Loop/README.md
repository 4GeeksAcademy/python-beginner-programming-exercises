# `15` Your First Loop

If you run this code you'll see a count from 0 to 99 (White characters).  Fix it so that it counts up to 100, you'll see 101 on green afterwards.

IMPORTANT: there's a Classroom dedicated to Arrays, we encourage you to go and finish those after this first Array exercise. (And then, come back).

**Can you fix it?**
