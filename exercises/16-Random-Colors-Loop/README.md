# `16` Random Colors (Loop)

We have created a function that returns a color based on a number between 0 and 3 (for any different number, it will return the color `black`).

## 📝 Instructions:

Let's say that we are teachers in a 10 student classroom and we want to randomly assign ONE color, between `red`, `yellow`, `blue` and `green`, to EACH student.

(only ONE color PER student)

1. Change the function `get_allStudentColors` so it returns an list of 10 colors, were each item in the list represents the color assigned to each student.

## 💡 Hint:

- You have 10 students, you need to loop 10 times.

- Each time you loop, generate a random number between 0 and 3 using the `randint()` function we saw on the last exercise.

- Use the `get_color` function on this exercise to get the color name from the number you get.

- call the function `get_allStudentColors` and print the result on the console.
