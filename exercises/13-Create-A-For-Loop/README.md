# `13` Create A For Loop

Loops are very useful. You don't have to rewrite the same lines many times.

The `for` loop lets you run the same code for different values.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Complete the function called `standards_maker`.

2. The function has to print 300 times the phrase "I will ask questions if I am stuck".

3. Call the function `standards_maker()`.

## 💡 Hint:

+ You can use the `range()` function in the for loop.
