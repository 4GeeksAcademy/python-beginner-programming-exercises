# `06` String Concatenation

String concatenation is a common task in programming that involves combining or linking two strings together.

You can think of this process as similar to connecting two train cars. If each string is a train car, concatenation is the coupling that joins them to form a single train.

In Python, you can concatenate, or join together, two strings using the `+` operator. This is how it works:

```py

one = 'a'
two = 'b'
print(one + two)  # this will print 'ab' on the console.
```

Here, the variables `one` and `two` hold the individual strings `'a'` and `'b'`. When you use the `+` operator between them, it acts like a glue, sticking the strings together end-to-end. In this case, it joins `'a'` and `'b'`, resulting in the concatenated string `'ab'`, which gets printed to the console.

## 📝 Instructions: 
1. Set the values for `my_var1` and `my_var2` so that when concatenated, the code prints `Hello World` in the console.
