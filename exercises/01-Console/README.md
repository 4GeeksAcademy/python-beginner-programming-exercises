# `01` Console

In Python, we use **print** to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called "the console".

Every programming language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows, Linux or macOS arrived).

Today, printing in the console is mostly used as a monitoring and debugging tool, ideal for leaving a trace of the content of variables during the program's execution.

This is an example of how to use it:

```py
print("How are you?")
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use `print()` to print `Hello World!` on the console. 


## 💡 Hints:

+ Remember, to run the code and see the output on the console, click on the box icon in the top left of the screen:
