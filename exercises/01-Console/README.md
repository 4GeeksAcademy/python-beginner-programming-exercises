# `01` Console

In JavaScript, we use console.log to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called "the console".

Every language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before the Windows or MacOS arrived). Today, printing in the console is used mostly as a monitoring tool, ideal to leave a trace of the content of variables during the program execution.

This is an example of how to use it:
```js
console.log("How are you?");
```

## 📝 Instructions:

Use console.log to print "Hello World" on the console. Feel free to try other things as well.
