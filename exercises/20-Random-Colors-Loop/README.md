# `20` Random Colors (Loop)

We have created a function that returns a color based on a number between 1 and 4 (for any different number, it will return the color black).

## 📝 Instructions:

Let's say that we are teachers in a 10 student classroom and we want to randomly assign ONE color, between red, yellow, blue and green, to EACH student.

(only ONE color PER student)

1. Change the function "**get_allStudentColors**" so it returns an array of 10 colors, with each item in the array representing the color assigned to each student.

## 💡 Hint:

- You have 10 students, you need to loop 10 times.
- Each time you loop, generate a random number between 1-4 using the **randint()** function we saw on the last exercise.
- Use the "**get_color**" function on this exercise to get the color name from the number you get.
- Print the color on the console.
