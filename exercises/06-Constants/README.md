# `06` Constants

Since 2015, Javascript also allows the usage of constants, they differ from variables because once declared, they cannot change their value over time like variables can.

To declare a constant, you have to use the reserved word **const** instead of **var**, like this:

```Javascript
const VERSION = '1.2';
```

Constants are super useful because some times, as a developer, you want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.
