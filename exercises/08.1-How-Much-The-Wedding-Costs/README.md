# `08.1` How Much The Wedding Costs (if...else)

Here is a table of prices for a wedding catering company:

Up to 50 people                     $4,000
Up to 100 people                   $10,000
Up to 200 people                   $15,000
More than 200 people               $20,000



## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please write an algorithm that prompts the user for the number of people attending
their wedding and prints the corresponding price in the console.

For example, if the user says that 20 people are attending to the wedding, it must cost $4,000 dollars.

## 💡 Hint:

Use if/else to divide your code and set the value of the price variable the right way.
