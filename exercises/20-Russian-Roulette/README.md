# `20` Russian Roulette

Have you ever played Russian Roulette? It's super fun! If you make it (wuuuajajajaja).

The revolver gun has only 6 slots for bullets... insert one bullet in one of the slots,
spin the revolver chamber to make the game random, nobody knows the bullet position.

FIRE!!!....... are you dead?


## 📝 Instructions:
1. The game is almost working, please fill the function "**fire_gun**" to make the game work
(compare the bullet position against the chamber position.)


## 💡 Hint:

- The function needs to return **You are dead!** or **Keep playing!** depending on the result, if the bullet was
at the same slot as the revolver chamber, then it will be fired (**You are dead!**).
