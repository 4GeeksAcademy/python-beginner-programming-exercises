# `09` Random Numbers

You can use the `randint()` function to get a random integer number. `randint()` is an inbuilt function of the **random** module in Python3.

 The random module offers various useful functions, including `randint()`, which generates random **whole** numbers within a given range passed as parameters. You can use it like this: `randint(numMin, numMax)`, where both the minimum and maximum numbers are included in the range.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. The code now is returning random decimal numbers, please update the function code to make it return an integer (no decimal) number between 1 and 10.
