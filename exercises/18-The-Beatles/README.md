# `18` The Beatles

Who does not like The Beatles?

A BBC study has proved that 90% of kids don't know the band... so sad. :(

This is the chorus of one of the most famous Beatles songs:

> Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
> 
> Whisper words of wisdom
> 
> Let it be

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `sing()` that returns a string with the lyrics that you can hear from 3:21 sec to the end of the song at 3:50 sec https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYfEBY9NM4.

## 💻 Expected output: 

```text
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
there will be an answer,
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
whisper words of wisdom, let it be
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The words "let it be" repeat all the time, you should probably create a loop for that.
