# `10.01` Creating Your First Function

## 📝 Instructions:

1. The function `add_numbers` is supposed to return the sum of 2 given numbers, please
complete the needed code inside of the function to make it behave as expected.

2. Expected Result: the exercise should print the number 7 in the console.

## 💡 Hint:

+ There is a function `"add_numbers"` already declared, it is receiving 2 parameters
(variables `a` and `b`),  as a developer you were given a task to fill the
function content with the code needed to sum variable `a` with variable `b` and
return the result of that operation.
